# Class-Activation-Map-CAM-Implementation
Class Activation Maps (CAM) is a technique used in Computer Vision for Visualization of the CNN.
Class Activation Maps (CAM) is a method to visualize and get insights into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It will create a heatmap and that is mapped over the input image.

## Limitations
1-We have to rebuild the model to incorporate the Global Average Pooling.
2- It can be noisy, and there might be some loss of spatial information

## Objective 
Identifying exactly which regions of an image are being used for discrimination
