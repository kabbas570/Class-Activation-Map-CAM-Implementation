# Class-Activation-Map-CAM-Implementation
Class Activation Maps (CAM) is a technique used in Computer Vision for Visualization of the CNN.
Class Activation Maps (CAM) is a method to visualize and get insights into a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It will create a heatmap and that is mapped over the input image.
